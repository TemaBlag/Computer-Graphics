# Theory

## Introduction
This project implements an image processing application using various techniques to enhance visual quality and transform images. The main methods implemented are:

- Pixel-wise operations (brightness increase, color inversion)
- Linear contrast stretching
- Global thresholding (simple threshold and Otsu's method)

## 1. Pixel-wise Operations

Pixel-wise operations are performed on each pixel of the image independently. In this project, two pixel-wise operations are implemented:

1. **Brightness Increase**: Adding a constant value to all pixels of the image, which increases the brightness.
    - $I'(x, y) = I(x, y) + C$, where $I(x, y)$ is the pixel intensity value, and $C$ is the added brightness.
    
2. **Color Inversion**: Inverting the intensity values of each pixel, resulting in a negative image.
    - $I'(x, y) = 255 - I(x, y)$

## 2. Linear Contrast Stretching

Linear contrast stretching (contrast enhancement) is used to improve the image by transforming the brightness range of the image to span the entire possible range [0, 255].

- The minimum and maximum intensity values of the original image are used for normalization:
- $I'(x, y) = \frac{I(x, y) - I_{\min}}{I_{\max} - I_{\min}} \times 255$
where $I_{\min}$ and $I_{\max}$ are the minimum and maximum intensity values respectively.

## 3. Global Thresholding

Global thresholding is used for image segmentation, where pixels are transformed into a binary image based on a given threshold.

1. **Simple Thresholding**: Applying a fixed threshold $T$, where all pixel values above the threshold become white (255), and below the threshold become black (0):
  $I'(x, y) = 255$ if $I(x, y) \geq T$, otherwise $I'(x, y) = 0$

2. **Otsu's Method**: An automatic threshold selection method that minimizes the intra-class variance (differences within each segment of the image).
    - The algorithm calculates the optimal threshold based on the intensity distribution of the pixels.

# Use Cases:

1. **Piecemeal Operations**

- **Image Enhancement**: Useful for improving local contrast or brightness in specific areas of an image.
- **Selective Filtering**: When certain regions of an image require different processing.
- **Custom Segmentation**: When specific features need to be isolated based on pixel value or neighborhood characteristics.

2. **Linear Contrast Stretching**

- **Low-Contrast Images**: Best suited for images where the intensity values are clustered in a narrow range.
- **Preprocessing for Analysis**: Useful before applying other image analysis techniques, such as segmentation or feature extraction, to ensure that details are more visible.
- **Medical Imaging**: Common in enhancing features in X-rays, MRIs, or other medical scans.
  
3. **Simple Thresholding**

- **Basic Segmentation**: Effective for applications where the foreground and background can be easily distinguished by intensity.
- **Image Binarization**: Useful in document processing, where text can be separated from the background.
- **Real-Time Applications**: Suitable for applications requiring fast processing and less computational complexity.
  
4. **Otsuâ€™s Method**

- **Dynamic Range Images**: Ideal for images where the foreground and background have distinct intensity distributions but no predetermined threshold is available.
- **Complex Images**: Effective in scenarios with varying lighting conditions, shadows, or where the foreground and background are not easily separable.
- **Biological Imaging**: Commonly used in medical and biological image analysis to differentiate between cells and background in microscopy images.

# Comparison: Simple Thresholding vs. Otsu's Method

Simple Thresholding is the best for images with consistent backgrounds and clear object boundaries. So let's show it:
