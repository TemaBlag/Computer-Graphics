# ImageMaster: Image Processing and Compression

## Description

**ImageMaster** is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to perform various image processing tasks. The project implements element-wise operations, linear contrast adjustments, and global thresholding methods for image compression and enhancement. The goal is to compare different image processing methods for enhancing image quality or compressing images effectively.

## Features

- **Element-wise operations**: Brightness adjustment and color inversion.
- **Linear contrast adjustment**: Enhance the contrast of images using a linear contrast algorithm.
- **Global thresholding**: Apply simple and Otsu thresholding methods for image binarization.
- **Image loading and saving**: Users can load and save images in various formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.).
- **Interactive GUI**: The application features an intuitive and easy-to-use graphical interface created with Tkinter.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages(Tkinter, Pillow, OpenCV, NumPy)
  
### Running the Application
1. Clone the repository
2. Run the script in you IDE
3. The graphical interface will open, allowing you to load and process images.
